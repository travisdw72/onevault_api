# Test: Verify Zero Trust Gateway Tenant Isolation

## 🎯 Purpose
Determine if your zero trust gateway already blocks cross-tenant access.

## 🧪 Test Setup

### Prerequisites
- Valid token: `ovt_prod_cf70c68cbc7226d4f6c6517696f6258621be5973e57feb324b148b42a8bb319e`
- Know which tenant this token belongs to (let's call it `TenantA`)
- Access to a different tenant ID (let's call it `TenantB`) 

### Test 1: Same-Tenant Access (Should Work)
```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://your-api.com/api/v1/tenants/TenantA/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ovt_prod_cf70c68cbc7226d4f6c6517696f6258621be5973e57feb324b148b42a8bb319e" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Expected: ✅ 200 OK (success)
```

### Test 2: Cross-Tenant Access (Critical Test)
```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://your-api.com/api/v1/tenants/TenantB/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ovt_prod_cf70c68cbc7226d4f6c6517696f6258621be5973e57feb324b148b42a8bb319e" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Expected Results:
# ✅ If Protected: 403 Forbidden ("Cross-tenant access denied")
# ❌ If Vulnerable: 200 OK (BAD - security gap!)
```

## 🎯 Interpretation

### ✅ If Test 2 Returns 403 Forbidden
**YOU'RE ALREADY PROTECTED!**
- Your gateway already compares token tenant vs requested tenant
- Tenant isolation is working correctly
- No additional database functions needed (but still good for defense-in-depth)

### ❌ If Test 2 Returns 200 OK 
**SECURITY GAP DETECTED!**
- Your gateway only validates tokens, doesn't check tenant context
- Cross-tenant access is possible
- You need enhanced validation functions immediately

## 🔍 What to Look For in Your Code

### Gateway/Middleware Pattern
Look for this in your API gateway code:

```typescript
// 1. Token validation ✅ (you probably have this)
const validation = await auth.validateProductionApiToken(token);

// 2. Tenant extraction ✅ (you probably have this)  
const requestedTenant = req.params.tenantId;

// 3. THE CRITICAL CHECK ❓ (do you have this?)
if (validation.tenant_hk !== requestedTenant) {
    throw new Error("Cross-tenant access denied");
}
```

### Alternative Patterns
Your gateway might:
- Convert tenant_hk to tenant_id before comparison
- Use tenant business keys instead of hash keys
- Have a mapping service for tenant validation
- Implement it in middleware vs route handlers

## 🎯 Next Steps Based on Results

### If Already Protected:
1. ✅ You're ready for production!
2. ✅ Token auto-extension is active
3. ✅ Consider our functions as defense-in-depth
4. ✅ Move scripts to `/api_functions` folder
5. ✅ Document your security model

### If Security Gap Found:
1. 🚨 **URGENT**: Implement tenant checking in gateway
2. 🚨 Deploy enhanced validation functions immediately  
3. 🚨 Audit logs for potential cross-tenant access
4. 🚨 Consider this a critical security fix
