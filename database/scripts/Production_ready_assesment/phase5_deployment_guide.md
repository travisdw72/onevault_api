## ðŸš€ **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### Step 1: Deploy Capacity Planning Infrastructure
```bash
# Navigate to deployment directory
cd database/scripts/Production_ready_assesment/

# Deploy capacity planning schema and tables
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d one_vault -f step_9_capacity_planning.sql

# Verify deployment
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d one_vault -c "
SELECT schemaname, tablename, tableowner 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'capacity_planning' 
ORDER BY tablename;"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
 schemaname      |        tablename         | tableowner 
-----------------+--------------------------+------------
 capacity_planning | capacity_forecast_h      | postgres
 capacity_planning | capacity_forecast_s      | postgres
 capacity_planning | capacity_threshold_h     | postgres
 capacity_planning | capacity_threshold_s     | postgres
 capacity_planning | forecast_utilization_l   | postgres
 capacity_planning | growth_pattern_h         | postgres
 capacity_planning | growth_pattern_s         | postgres
 capacity_planning | pattern_forecast_l       | postgres
 capacity_planning | resource_utilization_h   | postgres
 capacity_planning | resource_utilization_s   | postgres
(10 rows)
```

### Step 2: Deploy Growth Forecasting System
```bash
# Deploy growth forecasting procedures
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d one_vault -f step_10_growth_forecasting.sql

# Verify functions are created
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d one_vault -c "
SELECT routine_name, routine_type 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'capacity_planning' 
ORDER BY routine_name;"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
        routine_name         | routine_type 
-----------------------------+--------------
 analyze_growth_patterns     | FUNCTION
 capture_resource_utilization| FUNCTION
 create_capacity_threshold   | FUNCTION
 evaluate_capacity_thresholds| FUNCTION
 run_capacity_analysis       | PROCEDURE
(5 rows)
```

### Step 3: Verify Index Creation
```bash
# Check that all performance indexes are created
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d one_vault -c "
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, indexdef 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'capacity_planning' 
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;"
```

**Expected Output:** Should show 20+ indexes across all capacity planning tables.

### Step 4: Initialize Default Configuration
```bash
# Run initial capacity analysis to populate baseline data
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d one_vault -c "
CALL capacity_planning.run_capacity_analysis(NULL, true);"
```

**Expected Output:**

-- Create function to run regular capacity analysis
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION capacity_planning.scheduled_capacity_analysis()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Capture current utilization
    PERFORM capacity_planning.capture_resource_utilization(NULL);
    
    -- Run growth analysis for all tenants
    PERFORM capacity_planning.analyze_growth_patterns(NULL, NULL, 30);
    
    -- Evaluate thresholds
    PERFORM capacity_planning.evaluate_capacity_thresholds(NULL);
    
    -- Log completion
    RAISE NOTICE 'Scheduled capacity analysis completed at %', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Cron Job Setup (Linux/Unix)
```bash
# Add to crontab for automated execution
crontab -e

# Add these lines:
# Run capacity analysis every 15 minutes
*/15 * * * * psql -h localhost -U postgres -d one_vault -c "SELECT capacity_planning.scheduled_capacity_analysis();" >> /var/log/capacity_analysis.log 2>&1

# Run comprehensive analysis daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * psql -h localhost -U postgres -d one_vault -c "CALL capacity_planning.run_capacity_analysis(NULL, false);" >> /var/log/capacity_analysis.log 2>&1
```

### Windows Task Scheduler
```batch
# Create batch file: capacity_analysis.bat
@echo off
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d one_vault -c "SELECT capacity_planning.scheduled_capacity_analysis();" >> C:\logs\capacity_analysis.log 2>&1

# Schedule in Task Scheduler:
# - Trigger: Every 15 minutes
# - Action: Start program capacity_analysis.bat
# - Settings: Run whether user is logged on or not
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **PERFORMANCE TUNING**

### Index Optimization
```sql
-- Monitor index usage
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'capacity_planning'
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- Add additional indexes if needed based on query patterns
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_capacity_forecast_s_time_range 
ON capacity_planning.capacity_forecast_s(forecast_timestamp, resource_type) 
WHERE load_end_date IS NULL;
```

### Query Performance
```sql
-- Monitor slow queries in capacity planning
SELECT 
    query,
    calls,
    total_time,
    mean_time,
    rows
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE query LIKE '%capacity_planning%'
ORDER BY mean_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Memory Configuration
```sql
-- Adjust work_mem for complex forecasting queries
SET work_mem = '256MB';

-- For large datasets, consider increasing
SET maintenance_work_mem = '1GB';
```

---

## ðŸš¨ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: High Memory Usage During Analysis
**Symptoms:** Out of memory errors during growth analysis
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Reduce analysis window for large datasets
SELECT * FROM capacity_planning.analyze_growth_patterns(NULL, 'STORAGE', 14); -- Use 14 days instead of 30

-- Process tenants individually
DO $$
DECLARE
    tenant_record RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR tenant_record IN SELECT tenant_hk FROM auth.tenant_h LOOP
        PERFORM capacity_planning.analyze_growth_patterns(tenant_record.tenant_hk, NULL, 30);
        PERFORM pg_sleep(1); -- Brief pause between tenants
    END LOOP;
END $$;
```

#### Issue 2: Slow Forecasting Performance
**Symptoms:** Long execution times for growth analysis
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check for missing indexes
SELECT 
    schemaname, 
    tablename, 
    attname, 
    n_distinct, 
    correlation
FROM pg_stats 
WHERE schemaname = 'capacity_planning' 
AND n_distinct > 100;

-- Update table statistics
ANALYZE capacity_planning.resource_utilization_s;
ANALYZE capacity_planning.capacity_forecast_s;
```

#### Issue 3: Inaccurate Growth Predictions
**Symptoms:** Forecasts don't match actual growth
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Increase data points for analysis
SELECT * FROM capacity_planning.analyze_growth_patterns(NULL, NULL, 60); -- Use 60 days

-- Check for data quality issues
SELECT 
    resource_type,
    COUNT(*) as total_measurements,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN current_value > 0 THEN 1 END) as valid_measurements,
    AVG(data_quality_score) as avg_quality
FROM capacity_planning.resource_utilization_s 
WHERE load_end_date IS NULL
GROUP BY resource_type;
```

#### Issue 4: False Positive Alerts
**Symptoms:** Too many threshold alerts for normal usage
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Adjust threshold percentages
UPDATE capacity_planning.capacity_threshold_s 
SET threshold_percentage = threshold_percentage + 5.0
WHERE false_positive_rate > 20.0 
AND load_end_date IS NULL;

-- Enable suppression for noisy thresholds
UPDATE capacity_planning.capacity_threshold_s 
SET suppression_enabled = true,
    suppression_duration_minutes = 120
WHERE trigger_count_24h > 10 
AND load_end_date IS NULL;
```
